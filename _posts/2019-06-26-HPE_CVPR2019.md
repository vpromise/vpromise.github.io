## Does Learning Specific Features for Related Parts Help Human Pose Estimation?

### Abstract
- sharing mechanism can lead to negative transfer and deteriorate the performance.
- ankles and knees are highly related, is incorporated into the model, which helps resolve ambiguities in HPE.
- sharing features for those unrelated or weakly related tasks can deteriorate their performances â€“ a phenomenon called negative transfer.

### Contribution 
- All previous CNN-based HPE approaches take it for granted that features should be fully shared for all body parts. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to identify the problem of this practice and address it via a simple and effective part-based branching network. 
- This is the first attempt to exploit the probability distri-butions of part locations and their mutual information to group related parts. We show it is more effective than an alternative approach based on the human body structure. 
- Our model has an outstanding advantage on locating occluded parts, which is the greatest challenge for ex-isting methods. We also report new state-of-the-art re-sults on two well-known benchmark datasets.
